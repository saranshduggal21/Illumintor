# Illumintor
This is a project I have made it in order to aid the voice disabled, visually impaired or leg/hand handicapped people citizens of the world. 
This has also allowed to play with Machine Learning and add to the my repository of skills. 
To summarize, it changes the dimness of the light based on how far you are from the light.
Hence I used a capacitive sensor to do this. Since a capacitive sensor works by touch, I made it so sensitive that it used the movement of air around it as its “touch”. 
The reason it’s a universal solution for all disabled people is because, if you don’t have hands then you cannot use a light switch. 
Furthermore, voice assistants + smart light bulbs are expensive, and so people who don’t have legs or voice can also use it, as you would still be moving causing a drift in the air, which would still allow it to work.
